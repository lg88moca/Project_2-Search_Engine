# Project_2-Search_Engine
Name: Luciano Grullon </br>
</br>
Description: This webpage is a search engine utilizing Giphy API functionality. </br>
</br>
Details on how to use functionality offered: The user can type in what giphy GIFs he/she would like to source in the "search" box.</br>
</br>
Technologies used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, jQuery</br>
</br>
Ideas for future improvement: The styling can be improved with a more robust background color. The navigation bar can be cleaner and the search box can be smaller as well. The graphic below can incorporate another link to Giphy (although there is one up top already).</br>
